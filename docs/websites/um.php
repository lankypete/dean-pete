				Underscor Music is a music blog I created using a WordPress template and some handy customization.  &nbspI intended to bring my friends music tastes together, so I had to add multi user support.   &nbspI set everyone up with options to edit their own user photo/thumbnail, as well as soundcloud/social media links and icons.
