				What better way to learn a new app, than to design a new app.  This project was my first 8hrs with Sketch.  
			</p>
			<p class="centered">
				Although I use Sketch more for web design mockups now, it was great getting a feel for the program by doing something different. &nbsp I guess it was my first 8hrs of interface design too..

				The prototype features all the basic controls of a synth.  &nbsp I layed it out in the most organized way I could think of, given less than 5 inches.

				I can't take credit for the entire NoteTracks interface. &nbsp This project began with the working app and I wanted to try adding a feature to it. &nbsp My idea here was to add in an album art view.  &nbspThe app itself is designed to take notes on music.  &nbspI thought it would be cool to have the option of taking notes on the album art aswell.
